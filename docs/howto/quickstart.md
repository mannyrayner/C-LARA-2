# Quickstart

This is a throwaway “hello world” doc so we can test editing and link-following.

- Back to [Docs Home](../README.md)
- Read [ADR-0001](../adr/0001-documentation-and-structure.md)

## Editing test
Try changing a word here via the GitHub web UI, then confirm the change renders correctly in the repo.
